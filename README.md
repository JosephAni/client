# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to build a Full Stack NFT minting Dapp using Hardhat, ethers.js, Next.js and TailwindCSS. It follows the steps outlined in the official [open in Metaschool](https://metaschool.so/articles/build-full-stack-nft-minting-dapp/).

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

## Prerequisites
In order to build a full stack NFT minting dapp and be successful in this guide, you must have the following:

Node.js installed on your machine
Metamask wallet extension installed as a browser extension.
New to all this, learn here to set up your MetaMask account.
